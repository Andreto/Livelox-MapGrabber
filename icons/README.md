# Icon Placeholder Files

The following icon files need to be created for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the extension
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for the extension manager
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for the Chrome Web Store

These should be PNG format icons representing network monitoring (e.g., network graph, monitor, or signal icons).

You can create these icons using any image editor or find suitable icons from icon libraries like:
- Material Design Icons
- Feather Icons
- Font Awesome
- Or create custom icons

For now, the extension will work without these icons, but Chrome will show default placeholder icons.
